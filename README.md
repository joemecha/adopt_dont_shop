## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus
* Build out CRUD functionality for a many-to-many relationship
* Use ActiveRecord to write queries that join multiple tables of data together
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in
  views and controllers
* Validate models and handle sad paths for invalid data input
* Use flash messages to give feedback to the user
* Use partials in views
* Use `within` blocks in tests
* Track user stories using GitHub Projects
* Deploy an application to Heroku
* Build off of an existing codebase
* Basic styling with CSS and production images using Rails' asset pipeline
